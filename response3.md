## Please stop sending me your shitty Word documents

The author, Mark Scott, clearly HATES Microsoft Word. However, it appears that his arguments are not justified with hard facts and it is more of an opinion piece. He seems to know a lot about computers and programing/coding/all things of that nature, but it feels like he is upset that the rest of the population is not up to speed with him. 
Some of his main arguments are the following 
* Plain text should be plain
* Graphic design elements 
* Tables 
* Word Art

Each section elaborates on his strong dislike for the basic elements of Microsoft Word. And in his concluding paragraph, he uses sarcasm to deter people from sending him Word Art and Emails with Word documents attached. 

## Quote

"Just spare a thought for those of us that choose not to use Microsoft Word, and respect our right not to do so."

## Why Microsoft Word Must Die

In this piece, Charlie Stoss gives the reader a detailed history lesson on what life was like as a writer before Microsoft Word, and how Microsoft came to dominate and monopolize the word processing feild by the mid to late 90s. He mentions some of the changes that Word made over the course of 1999 to 2003. I enjoyed the history lesson, but after he's finished he goes on to say none of that was reason he hates Word. The REAL reason is because he is a writer and most of the large publishing companies have been "brainwashed" to use Word as their main word processor and EXPECT him to use it.

## Quote

"And they expect me to integrate myself into a Word-centric workflow, even though it's an inappropriate, damaging, and laborious tool for the job. It is, quite simply, unavoidable."

## Markdown: Markup That's Downright Simple 

(Dr. Evia mentioned! Great stuff)

This article is all about understanding Markdown. Erik Martin starts off by explaining why Markdown makes online writing so much easier without using complicated tags or metadata but is still easily convertible to HTML. Markdown is best for textual content versus graphic design or multimodal content. It is said to be a good source for businesses but not versatile enough for more refined users. 

## Quote

 “I see Markdown, or an evolution of it, being adopted by different industries to simplify content authoring, which is already happening.”
 
 ## Guide to Podcasting 
 
 This report talks about the importance of podcasts in the realm of journalism since it has become more popular online. If you're unfamiliar with podcasts, this report gives a good overview of the use of podcasts today as well as the pros and cons to them. Another cool part is about the different set ups podcasts use in order to make money. The case study I liked learning about was Buzzfeed because they decided to have a podcast solely to improve versatility, not because they were looking to get a lot of listeners. To me it says something about where podcasts still stand as a form of digital media. 
 
 ## Quote
 
 "While Serial generated much media attention, it did not prompt a spike in podcast audience growth, which has remained steady for years. However, Serial did result in increased interest from advertisers and publishers looking to enter this space."
 
 ## Podcasting Timeline
 
 I would never have guessed the first podcast came in 2003. Radio Open Source is still running today. The podcast "boom" feels very relative because I don't know if I would say it was a boom but after the iPod was introduced, podcasts began to show up more and more. In 2005 Apple added podcasts to iTunes, and NPR debuts in the same year. By 2015 only 33% of Americans have listened to a podcast, an exciting 22% increase from 2009.
